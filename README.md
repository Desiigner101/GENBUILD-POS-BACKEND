# GENBUILD-POS-Backend

This is the backend of my GENBUILD-POS project â€” a student-built Retail Billing Software.
It is powered by Spring Boot and serves as the API & server-side logic for handling data, requests, and business rules of the system.

# Tech Stack

Backend Framework: Spring Boot ðŸŒ±

Language: Java â˜•

Database: (to be added as the project grows)

API: RESTful endpoints for communication with the frontend

# Purpose

The backend is responsible for:

Managing billing operations

Handling product & inventory data

Processing customer transactions

Serving secure endpoints to the frontend

# Notes

This is my first ever POS backend project, made for the sake of learning and growth. Itâ€™s not about perfection, but about exploring full-stack development and challenging myself step by step.
